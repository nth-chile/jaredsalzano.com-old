    If you feel like a spy and your cover’s been blown<br />
    And the company’s suddenly bringing you home<br />
    And your compass is spinning and you’re all alone<br />
    But the bosses assure you of your safety zone<br />
    <br />
    There’s a secret society running the show<br />
    And the real information has nowhere to go<br />
    ’Cause the media moguls are funding campaigns<br />
    To ensure that the two-party system remains<br />
    As discussions arrive they hit too close to home<br />
    But the only opinion you got is your own<br />
    <br />
    I know the sun is gonna come out again<br />
    We can reason, respect, and maybe we’ll understand<br />
    <br />
    Our empirical dynasty’s flexing its tones<br />
    To some countries so humble, completely alone<br />
    If we question too closely, we might just offend<br />
    All the two-car garages and lawns that we tend<br />
    When the wild western wildfires finally come home<br />
    And the only perspective you got is your own<br />
    <br />
    I know the sun is gonna come out again<br />
    We can reason, respect, and maybe we’ll understand<br />
    <br />
    When the crooked elections have become the norm<br />
    And it turns out that man has created the storm<br />
    That is melting the ice caps on earth’s outer domes<br />
    It’s the greed that surrounds us. It’s what toppled Rome<br />
    But if Shackleton’s people could find their way home<br />
    Then the only excuse that we got is our own<br />
    <br />
    When the wild western wildfires finally come home<br />
    And the only perspective we got is our own<br />
    <br />
    As expressions go by and the feelings made known<br />
    Then the only respect that you got is your own<br />
